[[release-notes-5.10.0-RC1-junit-platform]]
=== JUnit Platform

==== Bug Fixes

* ❓

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* The `getMethodParameterTypes()` methods in `MethodSelector` and `NestedMethodSelector`
  have been deprecated and replaced by `getParameterTypeNames()` for greater clarity.
* Methods in `DiscoverySelectors` that accept a `ClassLoader` now declare the
  `ClassLoader` as the first parameter. This is only a breaking change for code that
  relies on the new methods introduced in JUnit Platform 1.10 M1.

==== New Features and Improvements

* New `@SelectMethod` selector support in the `@Suite` test engine.
* Classes may now be selected by fully-qualified name via the `names` attribute in
  `@SelectClasses`.
* New `selectMethod()` and `selectNestedMethod()` variants in `DiscoverySelectors` that
  accept a `Class<?>...` argument of parameter types as a type-safe alternative to
  providing the names of parameter types as a comma-delimited string.

  for details.
* Lifecycle and thread-safety semantics are now documented for the `TempDirFactory` SPI.
* New `reason` attribute in `@Execution` which can be used to document the reason for
  using the selected execution mode.
* The <<../user-guide/index.adoc#extensions-RandomNumberExtension, User Guide>> now
  includes an example implementation of the `RandomNumberExtension` in order to improve
  the documentation for extension registration via `@ExtendWith` on fields.
* The scope of applicability for `TestWatcher` implementations is now more extensively
  documented in the User Guide and Javadoc.
* New `assertIterableMatches` assertions.
